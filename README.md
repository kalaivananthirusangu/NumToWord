# Number to Words Converter

This is a React with ASP.NET Core project that converts a currency value in numbers to words. For example, if you enter 123456789,99, the app will output "one hundred twenty-three million four hundred fifty-six thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents".

## Features

- The app uses a custom API that converts a decimal number to words using a recursive algorithm.
- The app validates the input value using a regular expression and displays an error message if the input is invalid.
- The app uses the `axios` library to send a GET request to the backend and receive the response data.
- The app uses the `custom.css` file to style the components and add some animations.
